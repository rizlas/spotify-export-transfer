SpotyClone allows you to export Spotify playlists as a CSV file. Imagine that your friend wants your playlist at all costs, but you are a jealous guy and don't want random music to be added. With SpotyClone you can export your playlist and then, with the csv generated, import it into your friend's account. Thus you will have two different copies and no friendships will be more at risk thanks to SpotyClone.

SpotyClone, keeps friends together since 2019 :)
